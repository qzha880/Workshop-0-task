## Plan for this project
A moving green circle that can bounce back when it reaches the eage of the canvas. 

## Changes made during coding
I added more shapes with different colours - circle, square and triangle
Each shape has a different trajectory
- To achieve this, I added a third variable z
- Shape that move diagnoly downward --- x-axis = x, y-axis = x
- Shape that move diagnoly upward --- y-axis using the variable z, z = -x

### Problems met
At the start of the code, the variable y cannot equals 0, since when y = 0, thte shape will not move, therefore the yPos can never meet the conditionals.
